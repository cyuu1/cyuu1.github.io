<h3> Extra Credit</h3>
<p>I chose the text effects with backwards text. This script allows texts to go backward. For example:Hi, my name is Carrie Yu.</p>

<script>
    var message1="Hi, my name is Carrie Yu";
    var before = ""; 
    var after = ""; 
    var message2="";
    for (count=message1.length; count >= 0; count--)
    message2+=message1.substring(count,count-1);
    document.write (before,message2,after);
</script>
